# DEVils-Scrum-Tool
Web cooperative platform for software management. This platform helps teams to implement software projects based on
agile methodology (SCRUM) via sprints, epics, user stories, tasks and issues.

## Environment
This web application is created using Spring Boot and Gradle for build in the back-end, while the front-end is implemented on Vue framework. Unit and integration tests have been implemented on client and server respectively. For dependencies, check the README.md files in each directory.

## Build and Run Server
- In server directory, follow the instructions given on [Server ReadMe](./server/README.md) in order to install
the database and then build and run the back-end. Your server is up and running!

## Build and Run Client
- Just as above, move onto client folder, open a new bash instance and run `npm install` to install dependencies and
then `npm run serve` to run the front end. Read the [Client ReadMe](./client/README.md) for more.
