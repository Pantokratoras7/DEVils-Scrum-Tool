# DEVils-Scrum-Tool
Web cooperative platform for software management. This platform helps teams to implement software projects based on
agile methodology (SCRUM) via sprints, epics, user stories, tasks and issues.

## Environment
This web application is created using Spring Boot and Gradle for build in the backend, while the frontend is implemented on Vue framework. For dependencies, check the respective README.md files in both files.

## Build and Run Server
- In server directory, follow the instructions given on [Server ReadMe](./server/README.md) in order to install
the database and then build and run the back-end. Your server is up and running!

## Build and Run Client
- Just as above, move onto client folder, open a new bash instance and run `npm install` to install dependencies and
then `npm run serve` to run the front end. Read the [Client ReadMe](./client/README.md) for more.
