# Client Implementation
The front-end of DEVils-Scrum-Tool is created with Vue.js, so it requires an installation of nodejs.
The project was developed using Vue CLI (@vue/cli). Open a new bash instance to run client:

## Project setup
    npm install

## Compiles and hot-reloads for development
    npm run serve

## Up and Running!
Your client runs on http://localhost:9000/

## More configuration (optional)
### Compiles and minifies for production
    npm run build

### Run the unit tests (Jest)
    npm run test:unit

### Lints (code format) and fixes files
    npm run lint
