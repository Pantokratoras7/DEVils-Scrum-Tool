## Functional Requirements

| # | Title | User Type | Description |
|-|-|:-:|-|
| 1 | Index Page | All users | When a user that is not logged in enters the website, a welcome screen appears. It contains a navbar with sign in and sign up buttons, a second one with links to the sections below, which present some features of the application and the developers that implemented it. The last ones are presented by cards with links to their github profiles. Finally, a github link to project's repository is sited in footer. |
| 2 | Sign Up | All users | Fill out a form that contains the following required fields: email, username, first name, last name and password. If an email or a username is already in the database, then a is not permitted for usage (a message is shown). After submit, user is logged in and automatically redirected to user homepage (#11). |
| 3 | Log In | All users | Fill out a form with your email and password. After sign in, user is redirected automatically to user homepage (#11). |
| 4 | Forgot Password | All users | In Log In page, there is a link "Forgot Password" that redirects user to a page that contains a field to add his/her email and a button "Send". This procedure is supposed to send a link to user's email, in order to set a new password. However, this is NOT IMPLEMENTED, so it just pops up a funny modal. |
| 5 | Sign out | All users | The navigation bar has a drop down menu in the right corner. It gives the option to sign out and redirects user to index page (#1). |
| 6 | Profile | All users | User can access his profile via drop down menu in the right of navbar. In profile are shown: profile picture, full name, username, email and number of projects in which user participates. Description, country, job, company and bio are also displayed, if given. A user can check another profile, either by clicking in a project's team member profile (#11), or by writing his/her username on URL (hardcoded). |
| 7 | Edit Profile | All users | In profile page (#6) there is a button "Edit Profile" only visible to the logged in user's profile. There is a form in which he/she can edit the profile's information. The by clicking "Submit changes", the information are updated and the application redirects to profile page (#6). |
| 8 | Change Password | All users | In edit profile page (#7), a "Change Password" button exists, which expands a modal form with current password verification, new password insertion and new password check. If everything is ok, the "Update Password" button is enabled for submition. |
| 9 | Delete User Account | All users | In edit profile page (#7), a "Delete Account" button exists, which deletes the user's account, along with all his/her projects (and its items) in which he/she was product owner. None information attached to this user is stored in the database after this action. Before the final deletion, a warning pop up appears, as this action is irreversible. After account deletion, the users is redirected to index page (#1). |
| 10 | Notifications | All users | On navigation bar top-right, there is an icon that indicates if a user has any notifications. Whenever user redirects to a page, a REST request is sent to server, in order to look for pending notifications. These notifications may be either an invitation for a project, or a confirmation of acceptance (or decline) of such a proposal. After message read (by clicking "Accept", "Decline" or "OK" buttons), the notification is deleted from database. |
| 11 | User Homepage (same URL as Index) | All users | Show a grid with all projects that user participates in, both active (current) or archived (done). By choosing one, user is redirected to the corresponding project page (#13). Project are shown using pagination, by groups of four. |
| 12 | Create Project | All users | The user homepage (#11) has a button "Create a New Project" in the top right corner. On click, a modal appears with fields "Title" and "Deadline". Click "Add To Projects" button in order to enlist the new project of yours (in which your are Product Owner). |
| 13 | Project Page (Overview) | All users | Display information about the selected project: Project's Title, Deadline, Team Members and current Sprint's information, such as sprint's goal, sprint's number of tasks and issues, as well as sprint's deadline date. Team members is a list of users participating in this project, and each item in this list represents a user showing his/her fullname, email and role in the project. Also this item is clickable, redirecting to user's profile (#6). |
| 14 | Invite Members to Project | Product Owner / Scrum Master | In the project page overview (#13), there is a unit "Team" that displays all members of the project and their roles. At the end of this list, there is an input box. Product Owner and Scrum Master are able to add new members in this project by typing the new members' email and assigning a role to them (Scrum Master or Developer). By clicking "Invite", a notification is sent to the invited user, who has to accept or decline this invitation. |
| 15 | Accept Invitation to Project | All users | On the notification drop down button (#10), pending project invitations are listed (if any). These are consisted of the project name, the sender of this invitation and the assigned role. When a user accepts the invitation, he/she is redirected to the corresponding project page (#13). If he/she declines it, then nothing happens (except from notification deletion of course). |
| 16 | Leave this Project | Scrum Master / Developer | If a user does not want to be a part of this project anymore, he/she can leave it, by clicking the "Leave Project" button on top right of the "Team" unit. After that, it will be redirected on homepage (#11). |
| 17 | Update Project Information | Product Owner | On project page overview (#13), there is a button up right named "Edit Project". This button is visible only to the product owner, which can edit the project's information if he likes, by completing the forms and click "Save changes". |
| 18 | Archive / Activate Project | Product Owner | On the Edit Project button (#17), there is a button named "Archive Project (Done)". By clicking this button, the project becomes archived, so it is shown in the bottom grid in homepage (#11). Vise versa, an archived project can be re-activated by clicking the "Activate Project (Current)" button, sited in the project page overview (#13) of an archived project. Depending on their status (current or done), the opposite button is shown each time. |
| 19 | Delete Project | Product Owner | On the Edit Project button (#17), there is a button named "Delete Project". When this is clicked, a warning pop up is shown, warning that if the project is going to be deleted, then all its information (sprints, backlog, tasks, issues), will also be deleted. If proceed, this action is taken place and the user is redirected in home page (#11). |
| 20 | Product Backlog Page | All users | Under the main navbar, there is a second purple one, which indicates the three major pages, Sprints (#29), Overview (#13) and Backlog (this one). In Product Backlog page user sees all the product backlog items (pbis) that the project is consisted of. A group of cards representing Epics are shown, while in each epic resides user stories. |
| 21 | Create Epic | Product Owner / Scrum Master | On the top right of Product Backlog page (#20), there is a "Create New Epic" button, which pops up a modal when pressed. This modal is a form with the pbi's attributes. These are title, description (optional) and priority ratio buttons. When these are filled, the "OK" button must be clicked to add this new epic in the list with the other ones (a new card is created). |
| 22 | Edit Epic | Product Owner / Scrum Master | On the epic card top left, is sited a button named "Edit". By clicking it, a modal similar to the one above (#21) is poped up, in which the epic's information can be edited. Press "OK" to save. |
| 23 | Delete Epic | Product Owner / Scrum Master | When the modal of "Edit" button (#22) pops up, there is a "Delete PBI" red button on bottom left. Click this and another warning modal pops up. Press delete and this epic (along with its stories) is deleted from product backlog. |
| 24 | Show User Stories | All users | On the middle of an epic card, there is a button named "User Stories". When this is clicked, it reveals a dropdown with user story cards. Clicking the this card's button (named by the user story title), another dropdown is shown with the description and the priority of this story. Also an edit button is shown as well. |
| 25 | Add User Story | Product Owner / Scrum Master | On the epic card top right, is sited a button named "Add User Story", which pops up a modal. This modal is exactly the same with the "New Epic" modal (#21), and in the exact same way it creates a user story for this epic (nevertheless, both epics and stories are product backlog items - pbis). If the "User Stories" button is pressed (#24), the new story is going to be shown. |
| 26 | Edit User Story | Product Owner / Scrum Master | On the bottom left of the user story card (#24) is sited an "Edit" button. This pops up a modal identical to the edit epic's one (#22), updating the story's information in the same way. The updated information are shown immediately on the card, with no need of page reloading (with the power of AJAX calls). |
| 27 | Delete User Story | Product Owner / Scrum Master | The modal that pops up after "Edit" button is pressed (#26), has a "Delete PBI" button on bottom left. With the same way as the epic deletion (#23), this story is deleted from the epic parent (along with its tasks and issues). |
| 28 | Drag User Story from one Epic to another | Product Owner / Scrum Master | In some cases, a user story may considered to be better matched into another epic than the one is attached to. The user (product owner or scrum master) has to press the two epics' "User Stories" buttons (#24), in order to reveal their stories. Then, he/she grabs the story wanted, drags it into the other epic and drops it along with its user stories. The story dragged is now part of this last epic!! |
| 29 | (Old) Sprints Page | All users | Sprint page is accessible via "Sprints" item in the secondary purple navbar. It contains a list of all the sprints took place in this project. The sprints are listed by deadline date (newest to older), while a "Current" indication is shown next to the current sprint's number. In addition, each list item shows sprint's goal, deadline, and in badges the number of tasks and issues that it contains. When clicking on a sprint, the user is redirected to Sprint Backlog Page (#32). |
| 30 | Create New Sprint | Product owner / Scrum Master | This button resides either on top right of sprint page (#29), or on the project overview if the current sprint has ended (#13). Create a new sprint using a form with sprint goal, plan (both optional) and deadline (required). On the middle, a select button shows all the epics from product backlog, and the ones which will be selected, they automatically load their stories on the top list to the right. From there, user can select the stories he/she wants for the new sprint. These are placed on the list below. If a story needs to be removed from the selected ones, a click is all it needs. After submission ("Create" button), the user is redirected to the newly created sprint's backlog page (#35). |
| 31 | Sprint Backlog Page | All users | In this page, is the core of the application. The sprint's information (goal, plan, deadline) are presented on top, while below lays a big canvas with tasks. Each row of this table contains the tasks of a sprint's user story, while the columns separate tasks to "todo", "doing" and "done". Each task may contain issues, the total number of which is shown in "Issues" button. Tasks of the same story can be dragged and dropped between the 3 states (#40), while new tasks (#37) and issues (#41) can be created. Also, more user stories can be loaded into this sprint backlog (#35). |
| 32 | Edit Sprint | Product Owner / Scrum Master | On the top right of the sprint backlog page (#31), lies an "Edit Sprint" button. In the dropdown form, you can edit sprint's goal, plan and deadline, and then click "Save changes". |
| 33 | Change Sprint to Current | Product Owner / Scrum Master | In some occasions, an old sprint may need to become the current one, as some tasks or issues have to be inquired once more. In this case, user has to click the button "Change Sprint to Current", which lies under the "Edit Sprint" dropdown form (#32). Then the page is reloaded, and this sprint has become the current one (as the previous current is not current any more). |
| 34 | Delete Sprint | Product Owner / Scrum Master | On the bottom of "Edit Sprint" dropdown (#32), a button "Delete Sprint" exists. By clicking on it, a warning modal pops up. If proceeded, the sprint is deleted, but not the user stories attached to it, neither the tasks or issues attached to these stories. Moreover, if this is the current sprint, the previous one (by sprint num) is tagged as current. After deletion, the user is redirected to project page (#13). |
| 35 | Add User Stories to Sprint Backlog | Product Owner / Scrum Master | On the bottom of the page, there is an "Add User Stories in Sprint Backlog" button. This button triggers a dropdown, which displays exactly the same select epics button and the two lists for stories selection as the "Create New Sprint" Page (#30). By following the exact same procedure, we select the desired stories and click the "Add Stories" button. After this, the selected user stories will be added to the sprint backlog table above. |
| 36 | Remove User Story from Sprint Backlog | Product Owner / Scrum Master | On sprint backlog table (#31), user stories are the "index" of each row. If a user wants to remove this story from the sprint backlog, then he/she has to click the "Remove Story" button on the top right of story's card. A warning modal pops up and, if proceeded, the user story is removed from sprint backlog, however its corresponding tasks and issues are not deleted from database. |
| 37 | Add Tasks to a User Story | All users | Tasks can be added by a button in the top-left corner of each user story card. On click, an input box appears with placeholder "Add a new task". After clicking the "OK" button, the created task is automatically added on to-do column. |
| 38 | Edit Task | All users | On the top left of the task card, there is an "Edit" button, which pops up a modal. This modal contains a form, in which user can edit the task's description, and by clicking "OK" save it. |
| 39 | Delete Task | All users | At the bottom left of the popped up "Edit" button's modal (#38), a "Delete Task (and its Issues)" button lies. When clicking it, both this task, along with the issues attached to it are deleted from this user story, and of course from this Sprint Backlog. |
| 40 | Drag Task between "todo", "doing", "done" | All users | On the sprint backlog canvas (#31), the tasks are separated into 3 states (todo, doing, done). A user (mostly the developer) can take the task from one state and move it to another, depending on his/her progress on this task. A simple drag and drop is implemented for this purpose. Attention!! Tasks are allowed to move on their user story's row, do not drop them into another story's area, where they do not belong! |
| 41 | Add Issue | All users | On the task card top left, there is a yellow button named "Issues". This button shows the number of issues attached to this task and, when clicking it, a the issues list is presented. On the bottom of this popped up modal, there is a form, in which user can add a new issue, typing its description. Then, by clicking "OK", the issue is added on the list. |
| 42 | Edit Issue | All users | On the the above modal (#41), a list of issues is shown. Each item is clickable, leading to a new popped up modal with a form, to edit issue's description. Click "OK" to save the changes. |
| 43 | Delete Issue | All users | On the bottom right of the edit issue modal (#42), a button named "Delete Issue" is located. Click it and this issue will be deleted from this task's list of issues. This has to be the best action of every developer using this application!!! |
| 44 | Go back to Homepage (#11) | All users | Click the "ScrumTool" logo on the top left of the navigation bar. |

## Non-Functional Requirements

| # | Category | Title | Description |
|-|-|-|-|
| 1 | Security | Password Requirements | The length should be between 8 and 16 characters. Password must contain at least one upper case alphabetic character, one lower case alphabetic character, one special character, and one numeric character. |
| 2 | Security | Password Encryption | Passwords must be hashed using bcrypt function and a secure random salt before saving them to the database. This operation should be performed on the server side to prevent Dictionary and Brute Force Attack. |
| 3 | Security | SSL Encryption | Use SSL encryption to send sensitive data through the network like credit card numbers. Also, use an SSL certificate to make our customers trust us as a company. |
| 4 | Security | Prevent SQL Injections | Validate user input data and shield the application from SQL injections. This can be achieved by filtering the input data before storing them to database to ensure that the system is safe from this kind of attacks. |
| 5 | Security | Authentication | Identify an end-user in the system and validate that the user is telling the truth. Use Json Web Token (JWT) for this feature. |
| 6 | Security | Authorization | Authorization is controlled access to information in the application once a user is identified and authenticated. Also, partition users into anonymous and authenticated and give them the right permissions to modify or access data. |
| 7 | Usability | Usability Heuristics | User interface design must conform to Nielsen's usability heuristics. The user interface should be tested early in the design process to avoid common mistakes. |
| 8 | Usability | Consistency and System Standards | The user interface must be consistent.  1. The layout should be the same across the application.  2. The navigation bar must be in the same place. 3. Use the same wording and visualization for the same functions. |
| 9 | Usability | Error Prevention | The user should be warned on the following situations: 1. When he/she is about to delete something. (e.g. A task from the todo list on the sprint page.) 2. The primary action should be emphasized. (e.g. Submit button in a form) 3. When he/she completes a form. (e.g. Warn him/her if the password does not match the requirements before submit) |
| 10 | Usability | Minimalistic Design | The user interface should follow minimalistic design: 1. The interface should be easy to get used to. 2. Lots of text should be avoided. |
| 11 | Maintainability | Modularity | The code should be build in modules, so that independent parts accomplish independent tasks. This could be accomplished through the use of functions, interfaces and classes. |
| 12 | Maintainability | Design Patterns | Use of design patterns to solve common code modelling problems. (e.g. MVC pattern on back end and front end.) |
| 13 | Maintainability | High Cohesion - Low Coupling | - High cohesion means that we should bind the related code together as close as possible. - The low coupling means that we should organize our code through interfaces and make our classes be as independent as possible. |
| 14 | Maintainability | Layered Application Design | Application would consist of different layers like Presentation Layer, Bussiness Layer and Data Layer (3-Tier). |
| 15 | Scalability | Compress Files | Minimize the number of static assets, such as images, JavaScript, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), required by the application. Use always minified (.min.js) files for javascript files. |
| 16 | Scalability | AJAX Calls | Use AJAX-based asynchronous models for server invocations for partial page refresh. |
| 17 | Mobility | Operational System in different Devices and Platforms | The system should be operational in a wide range of devices and platforms, such as different screen sizes (Responsive) and web browsers. |
| 18 | Extensibility | Follow RESTful Architecture | Make a RESTful API which could be used in a future extension of our platform to a mobile application (Android, ios) without many changes. |
| 19 | Extensibility | Documentation (UML diagrams, navigation flow) | Present a general approach of the structure of the web application using UML diagrams. A new team member will possibly be informed of the current project state. |
| 20 | Deployment | Deploy on a remote server | The application will be independent of the development environment. It will be instantly deployed in any remote server that runs tomcat. |
